# autocluster
Matlab code for semi-automated clustering using gaussian mixture models (GMMs)

This codebase contains functions for detecting and extracting spike waveforms, selecting features, and clustering waveforms to isolate single units. The code is designed to work on multi-electrode array recordings. See WIKI for more detailed info.
